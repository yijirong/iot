## [Final project]  
Title: Temperature and Humidity Monitor  
Design a program that use the sensor to measure the temperature and humidity of the environment and send the information to your phone.  
DHT11, measure the humidity and temperatue of the environment.

# Weekly report 1
[2020-08-31] Took part in the first class and had a preliminary understanding of the main content of this class.  

[2020-09-05] Reviewed the syllabus and began to study the IEEE writing style.  

# Weekly report 2
[2020-09-07] Read the first and second chapters of book 'Internet of Things-From Research and Innovation to Market Deployment' and set up the Raspberry Pi.  

# Weekly report 3
[2020-09-14] Did the lab 2A (GPIO and serial communication) and read the third part of the book.  

[2020-09-15] Learned the basic knowledge and reviewed the second class.  

[2020-09-16] Run some code on Raspberry Pi and continued to read the third part of the book.  

# Weekly report 4
[2020-09-19] Learn IEEE writing style.

[2020-09-23] Did the lab 3, learned Python, used the pip to install packages in repository.  

[2020-09-24] Practiced writing Python code and continued to read the third part of the book.  

# Weekly report 5
[2020-09-25] Finished a simple experiment with Raspberry Pi and started to the chapter 4 of the book.  

[2020-09-29] Reviewed the class and learned some basic knowledge of the Python.  

# Weekly report 6
[2020-10-05] Reading the chapter 4 of the book and run some programs to improve my coding ability.

[2020-10-09] Kept studying the Raspberry Pi and review the IoT lesson. 

# Weekly report 7
[2020-10-13] Begin to read the fourth part of book 'Internet of Things-From Research and Innovation to Market Deployment.'

[2020-10-15] Using the Raspberry Pi to control an online fun catch does seem an interesting topic.

[2020-10-16] Begin to learn related knowledge about the 'fun catch'.

# Weekly report 8
[2020-10-20] Continued to read the fourth part of the book and studied the Raspberry Pi.

[2020-10-23] Studied Python and did some practice to improve my coding ability. 

# Weekly report 9
[2020-10-29] Continued to read the fourth part of the book and review the IoT lesson in the zoom.

# Weekly report 10
[2020-11-06] Begin to read the fifth part of the book and continued to learn some knowledge about the topic 'fun catch'.

[2020-11-08] Did the labs 4 and 5.

# Weekly report 11
[2020-11-12] Did the labs 6 and 7. After contacting much information about the 'fun catch'， I found that if I want to achieve this project I have to buy many hardwares and I did not have enough time to study the sealRTC to realize the function that let the user and the manager communicate through this app. So I decided to give up this topic and find another topic as the final project. I will try to accomplish this topic after class.

[2020-11-15] I decided to make a Bluetooth communication machine with the function of collecting temperature and humidity of the environment. Studied related information and did the lab 8.

# Weekly report 12
[2020-11-19] Bought DHT11 digital temperature and humidity sensor and the bluetooth module which are needed in the final project. And studied how to use them.

# Weekly report 13
[2020-11-25] Did the lab 9 and began use the DHT11 to measure the temperature and humidity of the environment.

[2020-11-26] I found that if I use the bluetooth to gain the information it would be limited in a small space, so I decided to use the Wi-Fi to receive the information. And I bought a DS 1307 clock to achieve the warning function.

# Weekly report 14
[2020-12-02] Continued the final project and tested the result. The expected function of the project is achieved and begin to thought if there are some other functions can be add into it.

[2020-12-04] Reorganized my final project and I learnd a way to capture the screen of the Raspberry Pi.

[2020-12-06] Did the lab 10.

[2020-12-07] Learnd the WM8960 audio module, and I would add a voice prompt function into the project and I would achieve this function after class.
