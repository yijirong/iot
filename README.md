# iot

[Final project]
Design a program that use the sensor to measure the temperature and humidity of the environment and send the information to your phone.

# Weekly report 1
[2020-08-31] Took part in the first class and had a preliminary understanding of the main content of the IoT.  

[2020-09-05] reviewed the syllabus and began to study the IEEE writing style.  

# Weekly report 2
[2020-09-07] Read the first and second chapter of book 'Internet of Things-From Research and Innovation to Market Deployment' and set up the Raspberry Pi.  

# Weekly report 3
[2020-09-14] Did the lab 2A (GPIO and serial communication) and read the third part of the book.  

[2020-09-15] Learned the basic knowledge about the iot and reviewed the second class.  

[2020-09-16] Run some code on Raspberry Pi and continued to read the third part of the book.  

# Weekly report 4
[2020-09-19] Learn IEEE Writing Style.

[2020-09-23] Did the lab 3, learned Python, used the pip to install packages in repository.  

[2020-09-24] Practiced writing Python code and continued to read the third part of the book.  

# Weekly report 5
[2020-09-25] Finished a simple experiment with Raspberry Pi and started to the chapter 4 of the book.  

[2020-09-29] Reviewed the class and learned some basic knowledge of the Python.  

# Weekly report 6
[2020-10-05] Reading the chapter 4 of the book and run some programs to improve my coding ability.

[2020-10-09] Kept studying the Raspberry Pi and review the IoT lesson. 

# Weekly report 7
[2020-10-13] Begin to read the fourth part of book 'Internet of Things-From Research and Innovation to Market Deployment'.

[2020-10-15] Using the Raspberry Pi to control an online fun catch does seem an interesting topic.

[2020-10-16] Begin to learn related knowledge about the 'fun catch'.

# Weekly report 8
[2020-10-20] Continued to read the fourth part of the book and studied the Raspberry Pi.

[2020-10-23] Studied Python and did some practice to improve my coding ability. 

# Weekly report 9
[2020-10-29] Continued to read the fourth part of the book and review the IoT lesson in the zoom.

# Weekly report 10
[2020-11-06] Begin to read the fifth part of the book and continued to learn some knowledge about the topic 'fun catch'.

[2020-11-08] Did the labs 4 and 5.

# Weekly report 11
[2020-11-12] Did the lab 6 and 7. After contacting much information about the 'fun catch'ï¼Œ I found that if I want to achieve this project I have to buy many hardwares and I did not have enough time to study the sealRTC to realize the function that let the user and the manager communicate through this app. So I decided to give up this topic and find another topic as the final project. I will try to accomplish this topic after class.

[2020-11-15] I decided to make a Bluetooth communication machine with the function of collecting temperature and humidity of the environment. Studied related information and did the lab 8.

# Weekly report 12
[2020-11-19] Bought DHT11 digital temperature and humidity sensor and the bluetooth module which are needed in the final project. And studied how to use them.

# Weekly report 13
[2020-11-25] Did the lab and began use the DHT11 to measure the temperature and humidity of the environment.

[2020-11-26] I found that if I use the bluetooth to gain the information it would be limited in a small space, so I decided to use the Wi-Fi to receive the information.
